# 📊 Data Analytics Project – End-to-End Analysis & Dashboard

## Overview

This project demonstrates an end-to-end data analytics workflow, starting from raw data exploration to building an interactive business dashboard.

The goal is to extract meaningful insights from data using Python and SQL, and present them clearly through Power BI and a final presentation.

The project covers:

- Data loading  
- Data cleaning  
- Exploratory analysis  
- Database querying  
- Visualization  
- Reporting

## Project Workflow

### Step 1: Data Preparation (Python)

- Loaded dataset using Pandas  
- Checked structure and summary statistics  
- Handled missing values in `review_rating` using median imputation by category  
- Standardized column names to `snake_case`  
- Created `age_group` using binning  
- Created `purchase_frequency_days` feature  
- Removed redundant columns  
- Loaded cleaned dataset into PostgreSQL

### Step 2: Business Analysis (SQL – PostgreSQL)

Key business questions answered:

- Revenue comparison by gender  
- High-spending discount users  
- Top 5 products by rating  
- Shipping type comparison  
- Subscribers vs non-subscribers analysis  
- Discount-dependent products  
- Customer segmentation (New, Returning, Loyal)  
- Top 3 products per category  
- Repeat buyers vs subscription likelihood  
- Revenue contribution by age group  

---

## Dashboard (Power BI)

An interactive dashboard was built to visualize:

- KPIs (Total Customers, Average Purchase Amount, Average Rating)  
- Revenue trends  
- Customer segmentation insights  
- Product and shipping performance  
- Subscription impact on revenue  

---

## Business Insights

- Subscribers contribute higher average revenue  
- Loyal customers drive significant repeat purchases  
- Certain products rely heavily on discounts  
- Specific age groups generate higher revenue  
- Express shipping users tend to spend more
